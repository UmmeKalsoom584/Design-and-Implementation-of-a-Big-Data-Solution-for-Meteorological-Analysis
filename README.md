# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Big-Data-Solution-for-Meteorological-Analysis
A Hadoop ecosystem pipeline that processes terabytes of weather data to identify climate trends like a +0.5°C temperature rise, using HDFS, Spark, and Hive.

Of course! Here are the key details of your project in an engaging, bullet-point format perfect for a GitHub README or portfolio summary.

### **🌩️ Meteorological Data Analysis with Hadoop & Spark**

#### **🎯 Objective**
- To design and implement a **scalable big data pipeline** for processing and analyzing **multi-terabyte meteorological datasets** to uncover climate trends and actionable insights.

#### **⚙️ Core Technologies & Languages**
- **`Hadoop (HDFS)`**: Distributed storage for raw and processed data.
- **`MapReduce (Java)`**: For batch processing and data cleaning.
- **`Apache Spark (PySpark)`**: For fast, in-memory computation of monthly averages.
- **`Apache Hive`**: For SQL-like querying on processed data.
- **`Sqoop & Flume`**: For data ingestion from databases and IoT sensors.
- **`Tableau`**: For interactive visualization and dashboards.
- **`Java 8` | `Python 3.7+` | `HiveQL`**: Primary programming languages.

#### **📊 Key Responsibilities & Implementation**
- ** Built end-to-end data pipeline** from ingestion to visualization.
- **Ingested** ~5 TB of historical data and 100 GB/day of real-time sensor data.
- **Cleaned data** using custom MapReduce jobs (e.g., handled missing values, removed outliers).
- **Performed distributed analysis** using Spark to compute monthly temperature and precipitation averages.
- **Enabled ad-hoc querying** with Hive on Parquet-formatted data for efficiency.
- **Created interactive Tableau dashboards** to visualize trends like warming and precipitation patterns.

#### **📈 Key Results & Insights**
- ✅ **Identified a clear warming trend**: Average temperature **increased by +0.5°C** over a decade in northern regions.
- ✅ **Mapped high-precipitation zones**: Flagged flood-prone areas for better disaster preparedness.
- ✅ **Supported agricultural planning**: Provided data-driven insights for optimal planting schedules.
- ✅ **Improved efficiency**: Reduced data storage by **30%** using Parquet compression and sped up query time from hours to minutes.

#### **🌟 Highlights**
- 🚀 Processed **5+ TB of data** efficiently on a 10-node Hadoop cluster.
- ⚡ Automated an end-to-day pipeline requiring minimal manual intervention.
- 📉 Delivered clear, visual insights that translated raw data into actionable business intelligence.
- 🔍 System designed for scalability and can be extended with ML (e.g., Spark MLlib for forecasting).

This project demonstrates strong skills in **big data engineering, distributed computing, and data analysis** using cutting-edge open-source technologies.
